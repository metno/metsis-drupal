Only non-core party modules that are covered by the Drupal security advisory policy (https://www.drupal.org/security-advisory-policy) should be considered safe for use. 

Other criteria that should be considered before using non-core party modules are the number of sites that report using the module, the number of downloads, issue statistics for the module and documentation. Even with all these criteria being satisfied, conflicts in functionality between modules may arise. Thus careful consideration must be given to the import of functionality offered by non-core party modules.

The Views module, for example offers functionality that is critical. In Drupal 7 Views is a non-core module while in Drupal 8 Views is adopted as a core-module. The details of this module can be found at  https://www.drupal.org/project/views

Another critical, non-core module for METSIS is the Views Bulk Operations module. For this module however, we have had to stay with version 7.x-3.3 (https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/views_bulk_operations-7.x-3.3.tar.gz) which is two sub-versions below the latest in the 7.x* branch. This is due to conflicts between the later versions and other modules. There are no security updates of this release as of 2018-12-19. This version of Views Bulk Operations must therefore be exempted when upgrading your site.
